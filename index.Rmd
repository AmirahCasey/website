While at WWU, she took part in research on the effects of PCBs and PBDEs on zebrafish and surf smelt. During her four years as an undergraduate, she was a marine science education intern at foundry10, the first undergraduate to teach a lab section of organismal biology, and a peer mentor for the Marine and Coastal Science. As of 2023, Amirah began attending the University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Science. She is a member of the Applied Ecology Lab and is advised by Dr. Mark Scheuerell. In addition to her studies in SAFS, Amirah is a member of the Future Rivers program and is on the board of Students Explore Aquatic Science (SEAS).
