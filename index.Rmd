## Bio

I graduated as an Outstanding Graduate from Western Washington University with a BS in Marine and Coastal Science and a minor in Spanish. While at WWU, I took part in research on the effects of PCBs and PBDEs on zebrafish and surf smelt. During my four years as an undergraduate, I was a marine science education intern at foundry10, the first undergraduate to teach a lab section of organismal biology, and a peer mentor for the Marine and Coastal Science program. As of 2023, I began attending the University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Science. I am a member of the Applied Ecology Lab and advised by Dr. Mark Scheuerell. In addition to my studies in SAFS, I am on the board of Students Explore Aquatic Science (SEAS), a PNW Climate Ambassador, NSF GRFP Mentor, Cascadia Consulting Temp, a past member of the Future Rivers program, and held a teaching assistantship in quatitative ecology. Pertaining to graduate studies, I am interested in mitigating the effects of contaminant and thermal stress on salmon in the Pacific Northwest through my collaboration with the NOAA Ecotoxicology program. 


## Education

**Western Washington University** | Bellingham, WA

- B.S. in Marine and Coastal Science, Spanish minor | September 2019 - June 2023

**University of Washington** | Seattle, WA

- School of Aquatic and Fishery Science, Data Science Option | September 2023 - Current

## Research

I am broadly interested in Urban Ecology and Climate Resilience, and through graduate school I hope to gain experience doing research at the intersection of science and policy while improving my quantitative and computational skills. As such, my first chapter focuses on how urbanization and climate change are impacting Puget Sound. Specifically, I have investigated how higher stream temperatures interact with tire-wear contaminant 6PPD-quinone to impact Coho salmon physiology. In my future work I hope to explore climate solutions and their social implications.

I have also created an educational StoryMap that explores the impacts of stormwater runoff, specifically 6PPD-Q, in the Pacific Northwest.
